                        <p>RentALL is a website developed by us--3rd year students of BSCS 3-3, namely, Carl Justin Jimenez, Joseph Tupaen,
                        Renwell Jean Angel, and Jheymie Nicole Lintingco. By providing system where item owners and people who only wants to rent an item is the main 
                        reason why the members are developing this kind of website. The members have researched the different 
                        websites that also lets the users rent their own items and rents an item and they have discovered 
                        that the existing rental websites which is the most common in the Philippines is only about renting 
                        properties, houses, condos, and apartment but there are no rental websites for any item that is why 
                        the members are aiming to develop this platform where sellers and buyers would be able to build their 
                        trust and communicate online.<p>
